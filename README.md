## Purpose

This trainer was made for learning purposes only. 
The code is probably trash and I will not be updating it if/when it breaks.
I used this project to learn the basics of memory manipulation and introduce myself to concepts necessary for reverse-engineering.

## Notes

You need to be loaded into your MMZ1 Save file BEFORE you open the trainer.
You may need to take damage first before enabling God Mode for it to work.
You will need to finish a level before immortal codename is applied.
